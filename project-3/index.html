    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Zach is very interested in just about anything technology related. This includes basic technologies, such as high and low voltage electricity, up to the most complex computer systems you can imagine. He works on alarm systems, and has several
      servers running in his house, all doing different things. Many of these servers are virtualized. Zach also has a radio show here on IIT's radio station.</p>

    <p>Outside of technology, however, Zach is interested in theater. In years past, he as performed in many plays and musicals, mostly through CYT. He enjoys finding ways to help others, or just generally spending time with people.</p>

    <h2>Family Life</h2>
    <p>Zach was born in McHenry County, and raised in Huntley, IL. He has lived there with his family all his life, and really got well connected with the Huntley Community overall. With 2 older brothers, and 1 older sister, Zach is the baby of his
      family. He has two dogs, Nash and Jada, and one Cat, Bess. Though he is a big animal lover, Dogs definetly take the cake in his opinion. As for extended family, his mom's side is farily small with only his two grandparents and an uncle. His
      dad's side, however, consists of 6 aunts and uncles, many cousins, and his grandma.</p>

    <h2>For Work</h2>
    <p>Zach does several different types of work when he isn't in school. He currently works for Fox Valley Fire & Safety over the summers as a Fire Alarm Technician testing and maintaining fire alarm systems all around the greater Chicago area. He
      also works for Pidge Industries, a water purification company, as their IT Consultant. Beyond that, he does a lot of IT work around his home town for local businesses, as well as individuals who require his assistance. For a short time, he ran
      a business in his town called "Fleck Teck Repair" where he serviced computers, phones, and tablets as needed. He learned quite a bit from running a business, and if there was a way for him to run his business at school, he would!</p>

    <h2>For Play</h2>
    <p>When Zach has free time, you can often find him within close proximity to his girlfriend, Katy, of whom he has been dating since October 6th, 2014. They spend lots of time cooking, baking, and watching <i>The Office</i> or <i>Friends</i> on
      Netflix. If he isn't around Katy, however, he's probably watching whatever YouTube's "up next" feature has in store for him, or making some videos for <a href="https://www.YouTube.com/c/ZacharyFleck">his YouTube channel</a>!</p>
