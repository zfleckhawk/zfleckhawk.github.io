    <h2>Explaination</h2>
    <p>Okay, so I have an interesting hobby to say the least! I LOVE to figure out how things work, and then hands on work on them myself. That is how I became interested in Fire Alarm technology of all things. What blows me away is just how
      technically advanced a thing most people find annoying (shout out to the students in MSV) can actually be, and not to mention how much your life can depend on it!</p>
    <p>Back in middle school, I had a friend who's dad happened to own a fire alarm inspection company. I expressed my interest and he helped me get my hands on some devices to work with, to help me start tinkering. Shortly there after, I began
      collecting things of my own, and also began buying parts for my collection online. Soon enough, I found myself with a system up and running in my house.</p>
    <p>With that home system, I began filming some videos to post on YouTube, in hopes I could help teach others about the world of fire alarm. To my surprise, those videos got attention and with 1600 subscribers and counting, I have some extra
      money from YouTube ads coming into my pocket every month. Pretty neat! Eventually this turned into a summer job for me, and I spend my summers inspecting and maintaining fire alarm systems for a local company.</p>
